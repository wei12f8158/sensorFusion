# Tips to improve detection environment

echo "ðŸ’¡ Improving Detection Environment"
echo "=================================="
echo ""
echo "Based on your debug images, here are recommendations:"
echo ""
echo "ðŸ”¦ LIGHTING IMPROVEMENTS:"
echo "  1. Add more lighting to increase contrast"
echo "  2. Use a light source above the table"
echo "  3. Avoid shadows on the blue plate"
echo "  4. Consider using a white background instead of dark"
echo ""
echo "ðŸŽ¯ OBJECT PLACEMENT:"
echo "  1. Place the blue plate on a white surface"
echo "  2. Ensure good contrast between plate and background"
echo "  3. Keep objects well-separated"
echo "  4. Avoid placing objects near table edges"
echo ""
echo "ðŸ“· CAMERA ADJUSTMENTS:"
echo "  1. Adjust camera angle for better perspective"
echo "  2. Ensure camera is directly above objects"
echo "  3. Check camera focus and resolution"
echo "  4. Clean camera lens if needed"
echo ""
echo "ðŸ§ª QUICK TESTS:"
echo "  1. Place a white paper under the blue plate"
echo "  2. Use a different colored plate (red, green, yellow)"
echo "  3. Test with better lighting"
echo "  4. Try different object arrangements"
echo ""
echo "ðŸ“Š MONITORING:"
echo "  Run this command to monitor improvements:"
echo "  python3 save_and_analyze_frame.py"
echo ""
echo "ðŸŽ¯ EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:"
echo "  - Higher confidence scores (>0.5)"
echo "  - More accurate bounding boxes"
echo "  - Better edge detection"
echo "  - Correct object localization"
