echo "2. Potential fixes:"
echo "   a) Check if model output needs scaling"
echo "   b) Verify coordinate conversion in distance.py"
echo "   c) Ensure display uses correct coordinates"

echo "3. Quick test:"
echo "   Run this command to test direct model output:"

echo "4. If the direct model output is correct but display is wrong:"

echo "5. If both are wrong:"
echo "   The issue is with the model itself"

echo "üöÄ Next steps:"
echo "   1. Run: python3 fix_bounding_box_position.py"
echo "   2. Compare fixed_bounding_boxes.jpg with debug_annotated_20250721_153537.jpg"
